# IntroMathMethods

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Dale-Black/IntroMathMethods.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Dale-Black/IntroMathMethods.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

Contains a collection of Pluto notebooks for the course [PHYSICS 208. Math Methods](https://catalogue.uci.edu/allcourses/physics/) at UCI. This is meant to be a refresher course on basic math concepts for the graduate physics program.

All the notebooks attempt to solve the problems (1) by hand using Markdown/Latex and then (2) with the use of [PythonCall.jl](https://github.com/cjdoris/PythonCall.jl) and [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). The notebooks main purpose is to solve the given homework problems, but they might contain some notes along the way (plus potential visualizations and explainers).
